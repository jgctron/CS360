Project Summary:

 Project Three: Creating an ‘Inventory Management App,’ a system for users to manage their inventory efficiently. The app allowed users to create, edit, or delete items, see them on a grid, and provide feedback when inventory ran low (via SMS). The purpose was to help users who needed an easy and intuitive way to manage their inventory but didn’t need fancy features or a complex system (image courtesy of the author)

Screens and Features:

 The inventory list, grid view, and login screen were the three main screens of this application, and all data were protected by user authentication. A minimalistic design was adopted for the UI to guarantee Simplicity for the User.
In this app, the designers place the most important features on the main screen to ensure the application's simple use and fast-language UI design, as well as guaranteeing the user's interaction with the device to meet their needs.

Approach to Coding:

 This was done to make the coding process more modular and maintainable. An iterative development strategy was exercised. The app was divided into several more minor features, developed and tested individually before the entire app was integrated. This approach helped in the maintenance of the code, as it was manageable, and in debugging processes. This sangeet app can serve as a model for future projects to ensure the codebase is clean and manageable in case of changes or updates.

Testing and Debugging:

 To ensure the app will work properly, I perform unit tests and integration tests to detect bugs right in. This is an important part of the process as it helps to identify whether the app is developed in accordance with its requirements and will work as expected. After doing the testing, I was able to pinpoint areas where the user experience would be improved and address these before the final product is released.

Challenges and Innovation:

 I wanted to make sure that the SMS notification worked well for different devices and operating systems. The solution required creativity. After researching, I realized the need within the app development process.

Key Success:

 An app, ensures that a user's best practices on mobile security
