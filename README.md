Project Summary:

 Project Three: Design an Inventory Management App to help users track their inventory. Users will be able to create, edit, and delete inventory items, view inventory items in a grid format, and receive an SMS text alert when inventory is low. A few key features would be the ability to search for categories of items as well as individual items and the ability to use a barcode scanner when scanning items for inventory.

Screens and Features:

 The main screens were an inventory list, grid view, and log-in with user authentication. The user interface was created to be minimalistic and straight to the point. Placing the essential features on the main screen makes the user experience faster and easier to accomplish. The UI design was derived from the user's needs, making the functionality more accessible than in the previous application.

Approach to Coding:

 Code was written with modularity and maintainability in mind, and from the beginning, an iterative development methodology was adopted—the app tackled one piece at a time and tested it before integrating it with the rest, which allowed for easier debugging and a cleaner and more adaptable codebase (so that, if it were ever updated or changed, the computational components would be available and ready to use).

Testing and Debugging:

 Please note that I conducted thorough unit and integration tests on all new features during the specification development to ensure the app works. This testing allowed me to check whether the app met the requirements and functioned as the specification stated. As a result of the testing, I saw areas where the user experience could be enhanced.

Challenges and Innovation:

 One of the biggest challenges was making the SMS notification work across all devices and operating systems. This was where we had to be innovative—no one research paper would help, so we had to find the answer ourselves with a bit of trial and error. Flexibility and adaptability were a huge part of the mobile app journey.

Key Success:

 The most successful feature of this project was the user authentication system. This feature shows that I have a lot of knowledge and skills in mobile security. It means that the application would not be a threat to the user's data and that the user would easily access it. The application meets the best mobile security practices, which was this project's key feature.
